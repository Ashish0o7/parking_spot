    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2><u>Our Idea:</u></h2>
    <p>The web application mainly deals with the parking of different vehicles inside a parking lot. From entry of a vehicle to manage the car parking space and storing the details of owner we handles everything in a better way.
        The parking area has many lanes and slots for parking, so there is a need to develop an automated parking system that eases the process of parking so that the vehicles can be parked faster and entry exit process can be made easier and reduces the time of entry to comfort owners of vehicles.
        This web application SecurePark mainly deals with the parking slots in the buildings like clubs, metro parking, hotels, and malls.</p>
    <h2><u>How we began:</u></h2>
    <p>Use of parking management system reduces the human effort and time with additional comfort. Conventional parking systems used in different parking areas do not have an intelligent monitoring system and the parking lots are monitored by security guards. A lot of time is wasted in searching for vacant slots for parking and many times it creates jams.
        So remembering all these discomforts and wastage of time Parking Manager works efficiently and provides the owners of vehicles to park their respective vehicles easily.</p>
